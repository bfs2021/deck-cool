## Before landing anything

Run one command, from the repo root, and land only on green:

```sh
pnpm verify
```

It runs every gate in order and stops at the first failure: `format:check`,
`lint`, `typecheck`, `test` (vitest in browser mode), `test:scripts` (the
scripts' own tests and the site's), `build`, `docs:check` (the code blocks in
the package README and the site's docs type-check), `compare:check` (the
README's comparison table is fresh), `test:packages` (publint and attw on the
packed tarballs, and the React entries' `'use client'`), `test:next` (a Next.js
server component renders a deck from the packed tarballs), `size` and
`test:e2e` (Playwright with axe against storybook, in Chromium, Firefox and
WebKit). The list lives in `scripts/verify.mjs`.

On its first run, `test:next` installs Next.js into `tests/next-rsc` from
that fixture's own lockfile, so it needs the network once; later runs install
from the pnpm store.

`pnpm verify --changed` runs only the gates the diff against `main` needs
(committed, uncommitted and untracked files; `--changed=<ref>` diffs against
another ref). `RULES` in `scripts/verify.mjs` maps each changed path to the
gates it needs, first match wins, and a path no rule matches needs every gate.

`--only lint,typecheck` runs those gates, `--project=webkit` runs `test:e2e`
in one browser, `--shard=1/4` runs `test` in one vitest shard of four, and
`--dry-run` lists the gates without running them. With no arguments, `pnpm
verify` runs every gate, as before.

CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs the same list, split into parallel jobs
by `CI_JOBS` in `scripts/verify.mjs`: `changes` works out which gates the
change needs, then `checks` (the gates with no browser but the next two),
`packages` (`test:packages`), `next` (`test:next`), `unit` (vitest, one job
per shard of four) and `e2e` (one job per browser) each run `pnpm verify --job
<name>`. On a pull request they run with `--changed` against its base, and a
job with nothing to run is skipped; a push to `main` runs every gate. `unit`
and `e2e` run in Playwright's container image, pinned by digest in `ci.yml`:
bump it with `@playwright/test`, as the comment there says.
`scripts/verify.test.mjs` fails if the jobs do not cover every gate, so a gate
added to the list runs in CI with no second list to update. CI does not
replace running `pnpm verify` locally; it catches the time you forgot.

`all-gates` is the one check to require in branch protection: it fails if a
gate job failed or was cancelled, and passes if each passed or was skipped as
the change did not need it. `release.yml` still runs the whole `pnpm verify`
in one job before it publishes.

Both browser suites drive Playwright's Chromium, and the e2e suite also
drives its Firefox and WebKit, and vitest its WebKit for the tests of what
WebKit alone does. Install them once with
`pnpm exec playwright install chromium firefox webkit`. On Linux, Firefox and
WebKit also need system libraries: run `pnpm exec playwright install-deps
firefox webkit` once, or install with `--with-deps`.

`size` prints each package's gzipped size and never fails: bundle size is an
aim, not a gate (ADR-0001). Read the numbers; do not add a budget.

`compare:check` fails when the comparison in `packages/react/README.md` no
longer matches a fresh measurement: after a bump of a compared library in
`tests/compare`, or any change to `packages/*/src` that moves slidedeck's
gzipped size. Run `pnpm build && pnpm compare` and commit the new table. The
size is reported, never budgeted (ADR-0001): a bigger number is not a failure,
only a stale one is. A release does not stale it: slidedeck's row has no
version.

Formatting is checked, never written by the gate. Run
`pnpm exec prettier --write <files>` on the files you changed.

## Releasing

`@slidedeck/core` and `@slidedeck/react` release together at one version
(`fixed` in `.changeset/config.json`).

**A change that a consumer of either package can see needs a changeset**: a
fix, a feature, a changed prop or type, a changed package file. Run
`pnpm changeset`, pick the bump, write what changed for the consumer, and
commit the file with the change. Tests, docs outside the packages, CI and
scripts need none. A breaking change is a `major`.

**A release** is `.github/workflows/release.yml`, on every push to `main`. It
runs `pnpm verify` first, then:

- with changesets pending, it opens or updates the "Version packages" PR,
  which bumps the versions and writes the changelogs. Nothing is published.
- after that PR merges, it publishes the versions npm does not have yet, with
  provenance, from the tarballs the verify job packed, then tags them and
  creates the GitHub releases.

The version PR is opened with the workflow's `GITHUB_TOKEN`, and a PR that
token opens triggers no workflow, so `ci.yml` does not run on it. Its merge
runs the release workflow's own `pnpm verify` before anything is published.
If branch protection ever requires CI on it, close and reopen the PR, or push
an empty commit to its branch, to start `ci.yml`.

**One-time maintainer setup**, all five steps done; 0.1.0 published on
2026-10-05. Until the last step, the jobs after `verify` show as skipped on
every push, and nothing is published:

1. In the repository's Settings, Actions, General, allow GitHub Actions to
   create and approve pull requests. Without it, the version job fails to
   open the PR.
2. Make the repository public. npm generates provenance only from a public
   repository, and both packages require it (`publishConfig.provenance`).
   Done: public since 2026-10-05.
3. Claim the `@slidedeck` scope on npm as an organization (#5).
4. Add an `NPM_TOKEN` repository secret for the first publish: a granular
   token that can publish the `@slidedeck` scope. npm configures trusted
   publishing per package, so a package must exist before it can have one.
5. Set the `RELEASE_ENABLED` repository variable to `true`.

With releases on, the publish job's first step fails loudly, before anything
reaches npm, if the repository is private or no credential can publish.

After the first publish, on npmjs.com add a trusted publisher to each
package: GitHub Actions, `pedrosousa13` / `slidedeck` / `release.yml`, no
environment. Then delete the `NPM_TOKEN` secret; later releases publish over
OIDC. Done on 2026-10-07 (#79): releases now publish over OIDC only.

## Site

The site is `apps/site`, a pagedeck site. `pnpm build` writes it to
`apps/site/site/`, with the `_headers` and `_redirects` that
`@pagedeck/adapter-cloudflare-pages` compiles from its routing, security
headers included.

**It deploys from CI**, in the `deploy-site` job of `ci.yml`, after
`all-gates` passes on the same commit. The job builds the site again, with no
pnpm or turbo cache, and uploads it with the pinned `wrangler` in `apps/site`
to the Cloudflare Pages project `slidedeck`, a Direct Upload project:

- a push to `main` deploys production, https://slidedeck.pages.dev.
- a pull request from this repository deploys a preview at
  `https://pr-<number>.slidedeck.pages.dev`, and keeps one comment on the
  pull request with that URL and the URL of the latest deployment.
- a pull request from a fork gets no secrets, so the job is skipped, and CI
  passes without a deploy.

It needs two repository secrets: `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`, a token with Account
· Cloudflare Pages · Edit, and `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`. The job fails loudly,
before it uploads anything, if either is missing.

## Agent skills

### Issue tracker

Issues live in the repo itself — GitHub issues on pedrosousa13/slidedeck, via the `gh` CLI. See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Triage labels

Canonical label names, as repo labels on pedrosousa13/slidedeck — plus `in-progress` and `P0`–`P3`, labels that stand in for a missing field. See `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.

### Domain docs

Single-context: `CONTEXT.md` and `docs/adr/` at the repo root. See `docs/agents/domain.md`.
