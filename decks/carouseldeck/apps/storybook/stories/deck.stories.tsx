 * point its viewport rests at, with several thumbnails in view, not the
 * current slide, so it scrolls freely and never feeds back into the main
 * deck. To follow the main deck it scrolls the thumbnail for the current
 * slide into view, nearest edge first, so a thumbnail already in view leaves
 * the strip where it is.
 *
 * It scrolls the strip's viewport by hand rather than calling `scrollTo` on
 * the strip's `handleRef`, which aligns to a snap point and moves the strip even when the
 * thumbnail is in view. It does not use `scrollIntoView` either, which also
 * scrolls the page to the strip when the strip is off-screen.
 *
 * Without CSS the strip shows one full-width thumbnail per view; set slides
 * per view on the strip's slides, as in Peek.
 *
 * Each thumbnail is a button named for its slide, so a screen reader hears
 * "Slide 3, button, current". Clicking one leaves focus on it; the main deck
 * announces the slide it moves to.
