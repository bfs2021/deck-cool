/**
 * Tracks the snap point a native scroll container rests at and asks it to
 * move. The browser does the scrolling and snapping; the engine reads where
 * it settled from layout, so slide size, gap and alignment stay plain CSS.
 *
 * The slides are the viewport's children, except snap targets, copies,
 * shells and spacers (see `slidesOf`): where an effect stacks the slides in
 * one place, an empty snap target per slide, or per shell with loop, lays
 * out along the axis in its stead, and the engine measures each slide by
 * its target.
 *
 * Loop: each slide mounts once (ADR-0013, as built in #144). Two in-flow
 * spacers push the slides two sets in, and five sets of empty, inert,
 * `aria-hidden` shells -- marked `data-carouseldeck-shell`, `-2` to `2`, `0`
 * the slides' own set -- carry the snap points either side of them, and in
 * their own set's stead: the real slides carry `scroll-snap-align: none`
 * unconditionally instead. Whichever real slide is nearest the viewport is
 * moved onto its shell by `translate`, driven by a `ScrollTimeline`
 * animation on the compositor where the browser supports placing that way
 * (ADR-0013, as built in #145), or by a scroll listener on the main thread
 * everywhere else (Firefox today), in the same task as the scroll event
 * that moved it, so there is never a blank frame at the seam (`place`,
 * `pinPlaced`). A set of slides too narrow for a shell to have room
 * beside its own slide -- its length less than the viewport plus its widest
 * slide -- falls back to rendering full copies instead (clone and jump,
 * ADR-0006, as built in ADR-0009): a copy of every slide before the slides
 * and another after them, each marked `data-carouseldeck-copy` (`before` or
 * `after`; DOM order does not matter), inert and `aria-hidden`, the
 * caller's to render. `DeckState.copies` says which the caller should be
 * rendering.
 *
 * Either way, scrolling past the last snap point arrives at the first, and
 * back, with no visible jump. Only the slides' own snap points are counted:
 * a step across the seam scrolls on past them, onto a shell or a copy, and
 * once the viewport comes to rest on one the engine jumps it, instantly, a
 * set of slides back onto the identical slide's snap point. Never
 * mid-motion: a jump then would show and stop momentum. But a touch or pen
 * pressed past the slides, a mouse drag starting there, or a wheel event
 * there along the axis, moves the deck a set onto the slides at once, where
 * nothing shows, so swipes and trackpad or wheel flicks chained faster than
 * the deck rests never run out of room (`shiftOffCopies`, `moveBy`). A set
 * of slides no longer than the viewport has nothing to loop: the engine
 * then reports one snap point, as for any deck whose slides all fit, and
 * the caller should drop whichever it was rendering.
 *
 * It also writes to each slide, and each copy, for CSS to read -- never a
 * shell, which has no content for a consumer's CSS to read -- once a frame
 * while the viewport scrolls and whenever it settles, never through
 * `onChange` (ADR-0003):
 *
 * - `--deck-slide-progress`: the slide's progress, its signed distance from the
 *   focal position in slides. 0 at the focal position, -1 one slide before
 *   it, 2.25 two and a quarter slides after it, the way the deck runs, so a
 *   vertical or right-to-left deck reads the same. The focal position is the
 *   snap alignment point of the slide resting at the current snap point (see
 *   `DeckState.focal`), placed between the slides by where their own
 *   alignment points are: with a slide exactly at the focal position, every
 *   slide's progress is a whole number whatever the gap. Where the scroll
 *   range keeps the focal slide from reaching it, as at either end of a
 *   centred deck, progress stays fractional at rest. Measured from the
 *   slides' boxes as they are drawn (their snap targets', where there are
 *   any), so an effect should not move a slide's alignment point: scale
 *   about it (`transform-origin`), not away from it.
 * - `data-in-view`: present on each slide with at least one pixel inside the
 *   viewport's scrollport, partly in view included. It hides nothing.
 *
 * It also writes to the viewport alone, as plain, unitless numbers
 * (ADR-0014), only at measure time -- mount, resize, a slide added or
 * removed -- and only where a value differs, never per scroll frame or
 * through `onChange`:
 *
 * - `--deck-viewport-step`: the distance from one real slide to the next
 *   along the axis (its size plus the gap), measured from the real slides'
 *   own measuring boxes (their snap targets or shells, where the deck has
 *   any), independent of a consumer's own centred `scale` on them
 *   (ADR-0014). Where they differ in size, the mean distance from one's
 *   start to the next's. Unset with fewer than two real slides, which have
 *   no "next" to measure a step from.
 * - `--deck-viewport-span`: the viewport's size along the axis, in
 *   multiples of `--deck-viewport-step`. Unset wherever
 *   `--deck-viewport-step` is.
