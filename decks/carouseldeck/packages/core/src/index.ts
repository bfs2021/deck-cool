 * `slidesOf`): where an effect stacks the slides in one place, an empty snap
 * target per slide lays out along the axis in its stead, and the engine
 * measures each slide by its target.
 *
 * It also writes to each slide, for CSS to read, once a
 * frame while the viewport scrolls and whenever it settles, never through
 * `onChange` (ADR-0003):
 *
 * - `--deck-progress`: the slide's progress, its signed distance from the
 *   focal position in slides. 0 at the focal position, -1 one slide before
 *   it, 2.25 two and a quarter slides after it, the way the deck runs, so a
 *   vertical or right-to-left deck reads the same. The focal position is the
 *   snap alignment point of the slide resting at the current snap point (see
 *   `DeckState.focal`), placed between the slides by where their own
 *   alignment points are: with a slide exactly at the focal position, every
 *   slide's progress is a whole number whatever the gap. Where the scroll
 *   range keeps the focal slide from reaching it, as at either end of a
 *   centred deck, progress stays fractional at rest. Measured from the
 *   slides' boxes as they are drawn (their snap targets', where there are
 *   any), so an effect should not move a slide's alignment point: scale
 *   about it (`transform-origin`), not away from it.
 * - `data-in-view`: present on each slide with at least one pixel inside the
