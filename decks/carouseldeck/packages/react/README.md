# @slidedeck/react

A headless carousel for React 19 built on native CSS scroll snap. The browser
scrolls, with its own momentum, snapping and focus scrolling; slidedeck tracks
where the deck rests and asks the browser to move. You compose the deck from
primitives that work with no stylesheet, and style it with plain CSS.

## Install

```sh
pnpm add @slidedeck/react
```

`react` and `react-dom` 19 are peer dependencies. `@slidedeck/react` is the
only package to install; it brings `@slidedeck/core`, the engine. The package
is ESM only.

## Quickstart

```tsx
import * as Deck from '@slidedeck/react';

export function Featured() {
  return (
    <Deck.Root aria-label="Featured products">
      <Deck.Viewport>
        <Deck.Slide>Slide one</Deck.Slide>
        <Deck.Slide>Slide two</Deck.Slide>
        <Deck.Slide>Slide three</Deck.Slide>
      </Deck.Viewport>
      <Deck.Prev />
      <Deck.Next />
      <Deck.Dots />
      <Deck.Counter />
    </Deck.Root>
  );
}
```

That is a working deck: one full-width slide per snap point, Prev and Next
buttons, a dot per page and a "1 / 3" counter. No stylesheet is needed. Give
`Deck.Root` an `aria-label`: it names the carousel region.

## Primitives

Each primitive passes its other props, `ref`, `className` and `style`
included, to the element in the table. Some render more inside it:
`Deck.Root` a visually hidden live region, `Deck.Viewport` a `<style>` with
the slides' default geometry and, with an effect such as fade, an empty snap
target per slide, and `Deck.Dots` its buttons.

| Primitive             | Renders    | What it does                                                                                                                                                                 |
| --------------------- | ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Deck.Root`           | `<div>`    | The deck: a region with `aria-roledescription="carousel"`, the deck's state and a polite live region. Holds the props below.                                                 |
| `Deck.Viewport`       | `<div>`    | The native scroll container. Its children are the slides. Focusable, so the arrow keys scroll it. Takes `effect`.                                                            |
| `Deck.Slide`          | `<div>`    | One slide, a group labelled "n of m". Its size and alignment are your CSS.                                                                                                   |
| `Deck.Prev`           | `<button>` | Moves one snap point back. Disabled at the first unless the deck loops. Its text is "Previous" unless you pass children.                                                     |
| `Deck.Next`           | `<button>` | Moves one snap point on. Disabled at the last unless the deck loops. Its text is "Next" unless you pass children.                                                            |
| `Deck.Dots`           | `<div>`    | A group labelled "Choose page" with one button per page, "Go to page n"; the current one has `aria-current="true"`. Style the buttons with `[data-slidedeck-dots] > button`. |
| `Deck.Counter`        | `<span>`   | The current page and the total, as "3 / 10".                                                                                                                                 |
| `Deck.AutoplayToggle` | `<button>` | Stops and starts autoplay: "Stop slide rotation" or "Start slide rotation". Renders only on a deck with `autoplay`.                                                          |

Prev, Next, Dots, Counter and AutoplayToggle render nothing when every slide
fits in the viewport, as there is nowhere to go. A consumer's `onClick` on
Prev, Next or AutoplayToggle runs first and can cancel the move with
`event.preventDefault()`.

`Deck.Root` props, besides those of a `<div>`:

| Prop            | Type                         | Default        | What it does                                                                              |
| --------------- | ---------------------------- | -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `defaultIndex`  | `number`                     | `0`            | The snap point to start at. Read once, on mount.                                          |
| `index`         | `number`                     |                | The snap point to rest at, controlled. Not with `defaultIndex`.                           |
| `onIndexChange` | `(index: number) => void`    |                | Called once each time the deck settles on a new snap point.                               |
| `handleRef`     | `Ref<RootHandle>`            |                | Receives `scrollTo(index)`, `next()` and `prev()`.                                        |
| `onFocalChange` | `(slide: number) => void`    |                | Called once each time the focal slide changes, with its index, or -1 when no slide snaps. |
| `clickToFocus`  | `boolean`                    | `false`        | Clicking a slide brings it to the focal position.                                         |
| `loop`          | `boolean`                    | `false`        | Past the last snap point is the first, and back.                                          |
| `drag`          | `boolean`                    | `true`         | A mouse can drag the deck.                                                                |
| `autoplay`      | `number`                     |                | Moves one snap point on every this many milliseconds. Off when unset.                     |
| `orientation`   | `'horizontal' \| 'vertical'` | `'horizontal'` | The axis the deck scrolls along.                                                          |

The package also exports the types `RootProps`, `RootHandle`,
`ViewportProps`, `Effect` and `Orientation`.

## Layout is CSS

Slides per view, gap, alignment and their breakpoints are plain CSS, never
props. By default each slide is as wide as the viewport and snaps at its
start. These defaults have zero specificity, so any rule of yours wins:

```css
/* Two and a half slides in view, a 16px gap, centred. */
.products [data-slidedeck-viewport] {
  gap: 16px;
}
.products [data-slidedeck-slide] {
  width: calc((100% - 2 * 16px) / 2.5);
  scroll-snap-align: center;
}
```

Media queries and container queries work as they do for anything else, and
the deck re-reads its snap points when the viewport resizes. The structural
styles a deck needs, such as the scroll container and its snap type, are set
inline on the primitives; your `style` prop is spread after them.

## The index: controlled, uncontrolled and the handle

The current index is the snap point the viewport rests at. Uncontrolled, pass
`defaultIndex` and read changes with `onIndexChange`. Controlled, pass
`index` and `onIndexChange`, as with a React input's `value`:

```tsx
import { useState } from 'react';
import * as Deck from '@slidedeck/react';

export function Controlled() {
  const [index, setIndex] = useState(0);
  return (
    <>
      <Deck.Root aria-label="Photos" index={index} onIndexChange={setIndex}>
        <Deck.Viewport>
          <Deck.Slide>One</Deck.Slide>
          <Deck.Slide>Two</Deck.Slide>
          <Deck.Slide>Three</Deck.Slide>
        </Deck.Viewport>
      </Deck.Root>
      <button type="button" onClick={() => setIndex(2)}>
        Last photo
      </button>
    </>
  );
}
```

A controlled deck scrolls to a new `index`. A scroll that settles elsewhere
calls `onIndexChange`, and the deck returns to `index` unless the parent takes
the new one. `index` without `onIndexChange` compiles, as a read-only input,
and warns in development. `index` with `defaultIndex` is a type error. Two
decks that share one `index` state stay in step, as a main deck and its
thumbnail strip do.

For event handlers that should not go through state, `handleRef` gives the
deck's moves:

```tsx
import { useRef } from 'react';
import * as Deck from '@slidedeck/react';

export function WithHandle() {
  const deck = useRef<Deck.RootHandle>(null);
  return (
    <>
      <Deck.Root aria-label="Steps" handleRef={deck}>
        <Deck.Viewport>
          <Deck.Slide>One</Deck.Slide>
          <Deck.Slide>Two</Deck.Slide>
        </Deck.Viewport>
      </Deck.Root>
      <button type="button" onClick={() => deck.current?.scrollTo(0)}>
        Back to the start
      </button>
    </>
  );
}
```

`scrollTo` clamps to the snap points there are. `ref` stays the region
element, as on every primitive. With pages, the index counts pages.

`onIndexChange` and `onFocalChange` fire only when a scroll settles, never
during one, and not for where the deck starts. Scrolling never re-renders:
React state changes when the deck settles somewhere new (the index, the
current and focal slides, the live region's announcement), when the number
of snap points changes, and, on a deck with `autoplay`, when autoplay starts,
stops, or pauses for a pointer or a hidden tab.

## Focal slide

The focal slide is the slide at the snap alignment point, the one the deck is
about. With one slide in view it is the current slide; with several in view,
centred, it is the middle one. It carries `data-focal`, and `onFocalChange`
reports it. The current slide, the first slide resting at the current snap
point, carries `data-current`.

With `clickToFocus`, clicking a slide brings it to the focal position, as near
as the scroll range allows. A click that ends a mouse drag does not, nor does
a keyboard click on a control in a slide.

## Loop

`loop` makes the deck run on past the last snap point to the first, and back,
with no visible jump. Prev and Next are then never disabled, and a drag, flick
or wheel crosses the seam. `Deck.Viewport` renders a copy of every slide on
each side of the slides, `inert` and `aria-hidden`; once the deck rests on a
copy, it jumps to the identical slide. Indexes, Dots, Counter, `data-current`
and `data-focal` count the slides only, never the copies. `scrollTo`, Dots
and a new controlled `index` go the direct way, within the slides. A deck
whose slides all fit does not loop. See [Known limits](#known-limits).

## Drag

A mouse can drag the deck by default. Snapping is off while it drags; on
release the deck projects the flick's velocity to a snap point and settles
there. A drag never clicks what it started on; a plain click still does.
Touch, pen and trackpad always scroll natively. Set `drag={false}` for decks
whose content is itself draggable.

## Autoplay

`autoplay={5000}` moves the deck one snap point on every 5 seconds, counted
from when it comes to rest. It stops at the last snap point unless the deck
loops. Pair it with `Deck.AutoplayToggle`, placed first among the deck's
controls, so motion can always be stopped (WCAG 2.2.2):

```tsx
import * as Deck from '@slidedeck/react';

export function Hero() {
  return (
    <Deck.Root aria-label="Highlights" autoplay={5000} loop>
      <Deck.AutoplayToggle />
      <Deck.Viewport>
        <Deck.Slide>One</Deck.Slide>
        <Deck.Slide>Two</Deck.Slide>
        <Deck.Slide>Three</Deck.Slide>
      </Deck.Viewport>
      <Deck.Prev />
      <Deck.Next />
    </Deck.Root>
  );
}
```

- A pointer over the deck, or a hidden tab, pauses it.
- Focus entering the deck, other than on the toggle, or the user moving the
  deck, stops it until the toggle starts it again.
- A preference for reduced motion stops it from the start.
- Moves autoplay makes are not announced, and the live region is off while
  it rotates.

The toggle carries `data-playing` while autoplay is on. Children replace its
text: give both states and show one with `[data-playing]` in CSS. Starting it
again where it stopped at the last snap point goes back to the first.

## Vertical and right-to-left

`orientation="vertical"` scrolls along the block axis. A vertical deck needs a
height, set on `Deck.Viewport` in CSS; each slide fills it by default.

Writing direction is read from the document's computed `direction`, so `dir`
on any ancestor applies. In a right-to-left document the deck starts at the
right, Next moves toward the inline end on the left, and a mouse drag and the
arrow keys follow.

## Pages

To snap in groups, make only the first slide of each group a snap point. Next
then moves a page, and Dots and Counter count pages:

```css
/* Three slides in view, three to a page, from 640px. */
@media (min-width: 640px) {
  .products [data-slidedeck-slide] {
    width: calc(100% / 3);
  }
  .products [data-slidedeck-slide]:nth-child(3n + 1) {
    scroll-snap-align: start;
  }
  .products [data-slidedeck-slide]:not(:nth-child(3n + 1)) {
    scroll-snap-align: none;
  }
}
```

Each slide is still labelled "n of m" by slide. The index, `scrollTo` and a
controlled `index` count pages, so when a breakpoint changes the page size,
the same index points at different slides.

## Progress and data attributes

Slidedeck writes continuous state to the DOM, not to React state, so CSS can
read it while the deck scrolls:

| Where                 | Attribute or property        | Meaning                                                                                                                      |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Each slide            | `--deck-slide-progress`      | Signed distance from the focal position, in slides: 0 there, -1 one slide before, 2.25 two and a quarter after. Every frame. |
| Each slide            | `--deck-slide-index`         | The slide's index. Static, so server HTML has it.                                                                            |
| Each slide            | `data-in-view`               | Any part of the slide is in the viewport. Hides nothing.                                                                     |
| Each slide            | `data-focal`                 | The focal slide.                                                                                                             |
| Each slide            | `data-current`               | The current slide.                                                                                                           |
| `Deck.Root`           | `data-index`                 | The current index, as of the last settle; before the first measurement, the `defaultIndex` (or `index`) as given.            |
| `Deck.Viewport`       | `data-orientation`           | `horizontal` or `vertical`.                                                                                                  |
| `Deck.Prev`/`Next`    | `data-disabled`              | Disabled, at an end or by your `disabled` prop.                                                                              |
| `Deck.Dots`           | `data-index`, `data-count`   | The current page and the page count; each dot has `data-index`.                                                              |
| `Deck.Counter`        | `data-index`, `data-count`   | The same.                                                                                                                    |
| `Deck.AutoplayToggle` | `data-playing`               | Autoplay is on.                                                                                                              |
| `Deck.Viewport`       | `data-slidedeck-effect`      | The effect's name, `fade` or `curve`, when it has one.                                                                       |
| Loop copies           | `data-slidedeck-copy`        | `before` or `after` the slides. Copies are `inert` and `aria-hidden`.                                                        |
| Snap targets          | `data-slidedeck-snap-target` | The empty elements fade lays out to snap to. Not slides.                                                                     |

Every primitive also carries a marker attribute to select it by, whatever
your class names: `data-slidedeck-viewport`, `data-slidedeck-slide` (copies
included), `data-slidedeck-prev`, `data-slidedeck-next`,
`data-slidedeck-dots`, `data-slidedeck-counter` and
`data-slidedeck-autoplay-toggle`. The live region is `data-slidedeck-live`.

Progress is a whole number for every slide when one sits exactly at the focal
position. An effect that moves a slide should scale about its snap alignment
point (`transform-origin`), not away from it, or it moves the point progress
is measured from:

```css
.products [data-slidedeck-slide] {
  /* abs() spelled with max() for older browsers. */
  scale: calc(
    1 -
      min(
        max(var(--deck-slide-progress, 0), -1 * var(--deck-slide-progress, 0)),
        1
      ) *
      0.2
  );
  transform-origin: center;
}
```

## Effects: fade and curve

An effect is a value passed to `Deck.Viewport`'s `effect`, imported from its
own entry point. A deck that imports none ships none of their code. The
viewport keeps scrolling, snapping and dragging natively under both.

```tsx
import * as Deck from '@slidedeck/react';
import { curve } from '@slidedeck/react/curve';
import { fade } from '@slidedeck/react/fade';

export function Effects() {
  return (
    <>
      <Deck.Root aria-label="Crossfade">
        <Deck.Viewport effect={fade}>
          <Deck.Slide>One</Deck.Slide>
          <Deck.Slide>Two</Deck.Slide>
        </Deck.Viewport>
        <Deck.Prev />
        <Deck.Next />
      </Deck.Root>
      <Deck.Root aria-label="Showcase">
        <Deck.Viewport effect={curve}>
          <Deck.Slide>
            <div className="card">One</div>
          </Deck.Slide>
          <Deck.Slide>
            <div className="card">Two</div>
          </Deck.Slide>
        </Deck.Viewport>
      </Deck.Root>
    </>
  );
}
```

**Fade** stacks the slides in one place and crossfades them by progress. Each
slide fills the viewport and snaps at its start, so slide width, alignment and
pages do not apply: a fade shows one slide at a time. Every slide but the
focal one is `inert`. Under reduced motion it cuts from one slide to the next
halfway instead of fading.

**Curve** fans the slides along an arc around the focal slide and fades them
with their distance from it. The slides keep their size, gap, alignment and
pages. The arc is drawn on each slide's children, so give each slide one child
that fills it, styled as the slide is seen. The radius, in slides, is
`--deck-curve-radius` (default 4), set in CSS on the viewport. Each curve slide
has `contain: layout`, so a `position: fixed` element inside it is placed
against the slide. Under reduced motion the content stays flat and only fades.

Both effects' styles are zero-specificity rules on `--deck-slide-progress`, so
your CSS overrides any of them.

## Theme

An optional stylesheet gives the controls (Prev, Next, Dots, Counter and
AutoplayToggle) a plain appearance. Slides stay your CSS, and a deck works
without it.

```ts
import '@slidedeck/react/theme.css';
```

Every rule is wrapped in `:where()`, so any selector of yours wins. Every value
is a custom property; set one on the deck or any ancestor:

| Token                              | Default                       | Styles                                                 |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `--deck-control-color`             | `#1a1a1a`                     | Text of Prev, Next, the counter and the stopped toggle |
| `--deck-control-background`        | `#ffffff`                     | Background of Prev, Next and the toggle                |

| `--deck-control-radius`            | `0.375rem`                    | Their corner radius                                    |

| `--deck-control-font-size`         | `0.875rem`                    | Their font size, and the counter's                     |
| `--deck-control-disabled-opacity`  | `0.4`                         | Prev or Next while disabled                            |
| `--deck-control-active-background` | `var(--deck-accent, #0b5cd5)` | The autoplay toggle while autoplay plays               |
| `--deck-control-active-color`      | `#ffffff`                     | Its text while autoplay plays                          |
| `--deck-dot-color`                 | `#767676`                     | A dot that is not the current page                     |
| `--deck-dot-hover-color`           | `#1a1a1a`                     | Such a dot under a pointer                             |
| `--deck-dot-size`                  | `0.625rem`                    | The dot drawn                                          |
| `--deck-dot-current-width`         | `1.25rem`                     | The current dot's width, so it differs by shape        |
| `--deck-dot-radius`                | `9999px`                      | A dot's corner radius                                  |
| `--deck-dot-target-size`           | `1.5rem`                      | The square a dot answers clicks in                     |
| `--deck-dot-gap`                   | `0.25rem`                     | Space between dots                                     |
| `--deck-accent`                    | `#0b5cd5`                     | The current dot, the focus ring and the playing toggle |
| `--deck-focus-width`               | `2px`                         | Width of the keyboard focus ring                       |
| `--deck-focus-offset`              | `2px`                         | Space between a control and its focus ring             |
| `--deck-transition-duration`       | `150ms`                       | Hover and state fades; none under reduced motion       |

Stopped, the autoplay toggle looks like Prev and Next; playing, it is filled
with the accent, paused by a pointer or not. With a light `--deck-accent`, set
`--deck-control-active-color` too, so its text keeps 4.5:1 contrast.

In forced colours mode, dots are drawn in system colours, the current one and
a hovered one highlighted, and so is the playing toggle.

## Server rendering

The primitives render on the server. Server HTML rests at `defaultIndex`
before any script runs where the browser supports `scroll-initial-target`;
elsewhere a layout effect moves there before the first paint. Either way there
is no layout shift with one slide per snap point.

The server cannot measure, so it renders Prev and Next, and Dots and Counter
with one page per slide. Hydration corrects them where that is wrong: it
removes the controls when every slide fits, and recounts Dots and Counter when
several slides share a snap point or the deck snaps in pages. Where `Deck.Root`
cannot see the slides ahead of time, as when `Deck.Viewport` sits inside your
own component, Dots and Counter render empty until hydration.

The package has no `'use client'` directive: in a React Server Components
framework, render the deck from a client component.

## Accessibility

What a deck does with no extra work:

- `Deck.Root` is a region with `aria-roledescription="carousel"`, named by
  your `aria-label`.
- Each slide is a group with `aria-roledescription="slide"`, labelled "n of
  m".
- Prev, Next, the dots and the toggle are native buttons with names. Dots are
  a labelled group of buttons with `aria-current`, not tabs, since a dot can
  stand for a page of several slides.
- A polite live region announces "Slide n of m" after a move the user makes;
  it is off while autoplay rotates the deck.
- No slide is hidden or `inert` for being off-screen. Tabbing into an
  off-screen slide scrolls it into view natively, and snap settles it.
- The viewport is focusable, so the arrow keys, Page Up, Page Down, Home and
  End scroll it.
- Loop copies are `inert` and `aria-hidden`: never focused, never announced.
- Under reduced motion, a move slidedeck starts (Prev, Next, a dot,
  `scrollTo`, a new `index`, a drag's release) jumps to its snap point instead
  of scrolling smoothly; autoplay starts stopped; fade cuts and curve stays
  flat.

One exception: in a fade deck, every slide but the focal one is `inert`, as it
sits under the focal one. Keyboard and screen reader users reach the slides
through Prev, Next, Dots and the arrow keys.

## Known limits

- **A loop copy renders the slide's children again.** Their state is their
  own, effects and refs in them run once per copy, and an `id` inside a slide
  repeats three times. Avoid `id`s in looping slides, or make them unique
  outside the slide.
- **Presses beyond the reachable copies are dropped.** A step goes at most a
  set of copies past either end. When presses come faster than the deck
  moves, the deck passes fewer slides than were pressed, rather than moving
  against a press or jumping mid-motion. At rest, a press always moves it one
  snap point.
- **Fade ignores slide geometry.** Slide width, alignment and pages do not
  apply to a fade deck.
- **Curve draws on the slides' children**, not the slide box: a slide's own
  background and border stay flat.
- **Server HTML can only start at a slide.** With several slides per snap
  point, or pages, the first paint at a `defaultIndex` may correct after
  hydration, and Dots and Counter recount.
- **A controlled index counts pages**, so a breakpoint that changes the page
  size points the same index at different slides.
- **Touch flicks across a loop's seam are not covered by automated tests**;
  they are checked by hand on a phone and a trackpad.

## Recipe: play a playdeck video in the focal slide

A social-style deck of videos: the video in the focal slide plays, muted, and
the others pause. Each slide holds a [playdeck](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@playdeck/react)
player; `onFocalChange` tells the deck's parent which slide is focal once a
scroll settles, and each player's handle plays or pauses it.

```sh
pnpm add @playdeck/react
```

<!-- example: apps/storybook/stories/video-deck.tsx -->

```tsx
import { useEffect, useEffectEvent, useRef } from 'react';
import * as Deck from '@slidedeck/react';
import * as Player from '@playdeck/react';

const REDUCED_MOTION = '(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)';

/** A deck of videos: the one in the focal slide plays, muted; the rest pause.
 * Under reduced motion none plays by itself; a viewer can still press play. */
export function VideoDeck({ sources }: { sources: readonly string[] }) {
  const players = useRef<(Player.PlayerHandle | null)[]>([]);
  const focal = useRef(0);

  const playFocal = (slide: number) => {
    focal.current = slide;
    const still = () => matchMedia(REDUCED_MOTION).matches;
    players.current.forEach((player, i) => {
      if (i !== slide || still()) void player?.pause();
    });
    if (still()) return;
    // A player loads as its slide comes into view: wait until it can play,
    // and play only if its slide is still the focal one.
    const player = players.current[slide];
    void player?.whenReady().then((ready) => {
      if (ready && focal.current === slide && !still()) void player.play();
    });
  };

  // onFocalChange does not fire for where the deck starts, nor when the
  // viewer's motion preference changes: play or pause for both.
  const replay = useEffectEvent(() => playFocal(focal.current));
  useEffect(() => {
    const query = matchMedia(REDUCED_MOTION);
    const onChange = () => replay();
    onChange();
    query.addEventListener('change', onChange);
    return () => query.removeEventListener('change', onChange);
  }, []);

  return (
    <Deck.Root aria-label="Featured slides" onFocalChange={playFocal}>
      <Deck.Viewport>
        {sources.map((source, i) => (
          <Deck.Slide key={i}>
            <Player.Root
              ref={(player) => {
                players.current[i] = player;
              }}
              source={source}
              defaultMuted
              loop
            >
              <Player.Viewport style={{ aspectRatio: '16 / 9' }}>
                <Player.Media />
                <Player.Controls>
                  <Player.PlayButton />
                </Player.Controls>
              </Player.Viewport>
            </Player.Root>
          </Deck.Slide>
        ))}
      </Deck.Viewport>
      <Deck.Prev />
      <Deck.Next />
    </Deck.Root>
  );
}
```

Show part of the next slide so the deck reads as a feed:

```css
[data-slidedeck-viewport] {
  gap: 16px;
}
[data-slidedeck-slide] {
  width: 80%;
}
```

Notes:

- The videos are muted so the browser lets them play without a gesture. Each
  keeps playdeck's own play button, so a viewer can pause the one playing.
- Under reduced motion no video plays by itself, and turning the preference
  on pauses the one playing; a viewer can still press play. Playdeck applies
  reduced motion only to its own `autoplay`, not to `play()` called from code,
  so the recipe checks `prefers-reduced-motion` itself.
- A playdeck player loads when it comes into view. `whenReady` waits for that,
  and the focal check stops a late load from playing a slide the deck has
  left.
- Do not combine this with `loop`: a copy renders its slide's player again,
  and its ref would replace the slide's.

The story `Deck / Playdeck Video` in this repo's storybook runs this
component, and end-to-end tests check that only the focal slide's video
plays, and that none plays under reduced motion.

## Comparison with Embla and Keen

Embla and Keen move slides with transforms and their own physics; slidedeck
lets the browser scroll. The size column is measured by `pnpm compare` from
pinned installs, and CI fails if this table is stale.

Min+gzip: each entry in `tests/compare/entries` is the same basic deck for all three, three slides with Previous and Next and no dots, bundled by Vite 8.3.1 with React external, minified, then gzipped, with the stylesheet the library needs. Each imports what its library documents: Keen's `keen-slider/react` has no exports map and resolves to its CommonJS build. Slidedeck's row is measured from this repo's build, so it has no version. The other columns, and where each was read:

- `@slidedeck/react`: packages/react/src/index.tsx; docs/adr/0001-native-scroll-snap-is-the-engine.md; docs/adr/0004-dots-are-buttons.md.
- `embla-carousel-react`: embla-carousel 8.6.0 `esm/embla-carousel.esm.js`: sets `transform: translate3d(…)`, no `aria-` or `role`, a `slideFocus` handler; embla-carousel-react 8.6.0 `esm/embla-carousel-react.esm.js`: exports the `useEmblaCarousel` hook; the accessibility cell is for 8.6.0: Embla v9, in prerelease, adds an optional `embla-carousel-accessibility` plugin (9.0.0-rc01 to rc03 on npm).
- `keen-slider`: keen-slider 6.8.6 `react.js`: sets `translate3d(…)`, no `aria-`, `role` or `keydown`; exports the `useKeenSlider` hook; keen-slider 6.8.6 `keen-slider.css`: the `display: flex` and `overflow: hidden` the slider needs.
