# Geometry is CSS; React re-renders only on index and focal changes

Slides per view, gap, alignment and their breakpoints are plain CSS on the
slides, never props. Slidedeck reads the resulting snap points from layout.
That makes responsiveness free and keeps it out of slidedeck's API.

React state changes only when the current index or the focal slide changes.
Continuous values — progress, in-view state — are written to the DOM as custom
properties and data attributes, so scrolling never re-renders.

The structural styles a deck needs to function (the scroller, snap type,
overflow) are set inline on the primitives, as playdeck does, so a deck works
with no stylesheet. Appearance ships as an optional `theme.css`.

The first server-rendered paint shows slide 0; a layout effect moves to
`defaultIndex` before the browser paints, using `scroll-initial-target` where
supported. No layout shift either way.
