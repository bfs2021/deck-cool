# @drawerdeck/react

A headless drawer (a bottom sheet) for React 19, built on native scrolling.
The sheet sits in a scroll-snap container: the browser drags, flings and
settles it at its snap points, the way it already scrolls a page.
`Drawer.Popup` renders a `<dialog>`, which gives the top layer, focus
trapping, an inert page behind it and Escape, with no portal to manage. You
compose the drawer from parts that need no stylesheet, and style it with
plain CSS.

This is a beta: bottom sheets only, with a single modal layer.

The guides, the reference and the recipes, each with a live demo, are at
[drawer.deck.cool/docs](https://drawer.deck.cool/docs/).

## Install

```sh
pnpm add @drawerdeck/react
```

`react` and `react-dom` 19 are peer dependencies. `@drawerdeck/react` is the
only package to install. It brings `@drawerdeck/core`, the engine, with it.
The package is ESM only.

## Quickstart

```tsx
import * as Drawer from '@drawerdeck/react';

export function Settings() {
  return (
    <Drawer.Root>
      <Drawer.Trigger>Open</Drawer.Trigger>
      <Drawer.Popup>
        <Drawer.Backdrop />
        <Drawer.Viewport>
          <Drawer.Panel>
            <Drawer.Handle />
            <Drawer.Title>Settings</Drawer.Title>
            <Drawer.Content>…</Drawer.Content>
            <Drawer.Close>Done</Drawer.Close>
          </Drawer.Panel>
        </Drawer.Viewport>
      </Drawer.Popup>
    </Drawer.Root>
  );
}
```

With no `snapPoints`, the drawer has one open point: the panel shown at its
content height, capped by its own CSS `max-height`. `Drawer.Popup` renders
the `<dialog>` on the top layer, so it needs no portal.
