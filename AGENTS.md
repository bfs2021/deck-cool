# AGENTS.md

## Agent skills

### Issue tracker

Issues live in the repo itself — GitHub issues on pedrosousa13/deck-cool, via the `gh` CLI. See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Triage labels

Canonical label names, as repo labels on pedrosousa13/deck-cool — plus `in-progress` and `P0`–`P3`, labels that stand in for a missing field. See `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.

### Domain docs

Single-context: `CONTEXT.md` and `docs/adr/` at the repo root. See `docs/agents/domain.md`.

## Working in this repo

Node 24 and pnpm. Sites live in `sites/<name>`, shared code in `packages/<name>`. Run every command from the repo root:

```sh
pnpm install     # install every site and package
pnpm build       # build every site: pagedeck sync, then pagedeck build
pnpm typecheck   # tsc in every site and package
pnpm test        # vitest across the workspace
```

`pnpm test` builds deck-cool once, in a global setup, and drives the built site in Playwright's Chromium. Install it once with `pnpm exec playwright install chromium`.

`pnpm build` writes each site to `sites/<name>/site/`, and its budget report to `sites/<name>/.pagedeck/budget-report.json`. Every `@pagedeck/*` package is pinned to one exact version; upgrade them together. CI runs them on every push, installing with `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`, and lints every workflow with actionlint first. To run it locally: `docker run --rm -v "$PWD:/repo" -w /repo rhysd/actionlint:1.7.12`.

`packages/brand` is the brand kit every site shares: `styles/brand.css`, the icons in `public/icons/`, the decks module (`@deck-cool/brand/decks`), and the Family bar (`@deck-cool/brand/family-bar`), styled by `styles/family-bar.css`. `styles/umbrella.css` styles deck.cool's home page. A site lists the stylesheets it needs in `build.css`, `brand.css` first, and the build compiles them into one hashed sheet under `/assets/` that every page links from `<head>`. `public/` holds only the icons and `.assetsignore`, and a site serves it from its root through `build.passthrough`. Each icon's `apple-touch-icon.png` is rendered from its `still.svg` and checked in. After you change a still icon, run `pnpm --filter @deck-cool/brand render-touch-icons`. `pnpm test` fails while a PNG is stale.

deck.cool is deployed with wrangler, as Workers Static Assets, by `.github/workflows/deploy-deck-cool.yml`: a dry run on every push, a publish only on a manual run with `apply`. `docs/deploy.md` is the runbook.

## Releasing a deck

When a deck publishes a release, `.github/workflows/bump-deck.yml` sets every `@<deck>/*` dependency in the workspace to the new version, updates the lockfile, and opens a PR titled `Bump <deck> to <version>` from the branch `bump/<deck>-<version>`. The PR merges itself, squashed, once CI passes. A second dispatch for the same version does nothing. A dispatch for a version older than one the workspace already has fails and changes nothing: the workflow never downgrades. The bump logic is `packages/bump-deck`.

The workflow runs on a `repository_dispatch` of type `deck-released`, with this payload:

```json
{ "deck": "slidedeck", "version": "1.4.0" }
```

`deck` is `slidedeck`, `playdeck` or `pagedeck`, and `version` is `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` with no `v`. The payload is untrusted. The workflow checks out the repo and sets up Node and pnpm first, none of which reads the payload. The payload then reaches only the check step, through env, and the workflow stops there on any other payload. Every later step reads the checked values.

pnpm holds back a version for `minimumReleaseAge` (a day) unless `minimumReleaseAgeExclude` lists it, and the workflow keeps that hold: a dispatch for a younger version fails, says so, and pushes nothing. Send the dispatch again once the version is a day old. `@pagedeck/*` is excluded today, so a pagedeck release is bumped at once, and its PR says the hold was bypassed.

Each deck's release workflow adds one step after `npm publish`. It gets a token from the `deck-cool-releases` App, with the repo variable `DECK_APP_ID` and the repo secret `DECK_APP_PRIVATE_KEY`, and sends the dispatch:

```yaml
      - name: Get a token from the deck-cool-releases App
        id: app
        uses: actions/create-github-app-token@bcd2ba49218906704ab6c1aa796996da409d3eb1 # v3.2.0
        with:
          app-id: ${{ vars.DECK_APP_ID }}
          private-key: ${{ secrets.DECK_APP_PRIVATE_KEY }}
          owner: pedrosousa13
          repositories: deck-cool
          permission-contents: write
      - name: Tell deck-cool
        env:
          GH_TOKEN: ${{ steps.app.outputs.token }}
          VERSION: <the version just published>
        run: |
          gh api repos/pedrosousa13/deck-cool/dispatches \
            -f event_type=deck-released \
            -f "client_payload[deck]=slidedeck" \
            -f "client_payload[version]=${VERSION}"
```
