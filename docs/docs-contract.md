# The docs contract

This is for a deck's maintainer. It says what a docs package must hold so that the deck's site on deck.cool can build from it. Why the docs arrive this way is in [ADR 0001](adr/0001-docs-arrive-as-an-npm-package.md).

## The package

Publish an npm package named `@<deck>/docs` (for example `@slidedeck/docs`) at the same version as the deck's code. It holds markdown, one `nav.json` and images, and no code.

```
@slidedeck/docs/
├── package.json
├── nav.json
├── index.md
├── guides/
│   ├── install.md
│   └── layout.md
└── assets/
    └── layout-grid.png
```

- **Pages** are the `.md` files anywhere under the package root.
- **`nav.json`** is at the package root.
- **Images** are under `assets/`.

These files are not pages: `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md` and `LICENSE.md` at the package root (npm adds them to every package), every `.md` file under `assets/`, and everything under `node_modules/`.

## Frontmatter

Every page opens with a frontmatter block that has a `title` and a `description`. Both are required, and neither can be empty.

```md
---
title: Layout
description: How slidedeck sizes a slide to its container.
---

A slide fills the width of its container...
```

The site shows `title` as the page's heading, so do not open the body with a `#` heading: the first one is dropped. Other fields are allowed, and the site ignores them.

## `nav.json`

An ordered list of groups. Each group has a `label` and an ordered list of `pages`. A page is named by its path from the package root, with `.md`.

```json
[
  { "label": "Start", "pages": ["index.md", "guides/install.md"] },
  { "label": "Guides", "pages": ["guides/layout.md"] }
]
```

The site's navigation shows the groups and pages in this order. Every page must be in `nav.json` once, and every path in `nav.json` must be a page.

## Routes

A page's route comes from its path. The site picks the base, for example `/docs`.

| File | Route |
| --- | --- |
| `index.md` | `/docs` |
| `guides/layout.md` | `/docs/guides/layout` |
| `guides/index.md` | `/docs/guides` |

Two files cannot share a route, so a package cannot have both `guides.md` and `guides/index.md`.

## Links

Link to another page by its relative path to the `.md` file, from the page you are writing. A `#fragment` is kept. The site rewrites the link to the page's route.

```md
See [Install](./install.md#requirements), or go [back to the start](../index.md).
```

A reference-style link (`[Install][install]` with `[install]: ./install.md` below) works the same. A link with a scheme (`https:`, `mailto:`), a link that starts with `/` and a link that is only a `#fragment` are left as they are. A relative link to anything that is not a `.md` file fails the build.

## Images

Put the file under `assets/`, and link it relatively from the page.

```md
![The layout grid](../assets/layout-grid.png)
```

## Demos

The docs hold no components. To show a live demo, put a marker on its own line where the demo goes:

```md
<!-- demo:counter -->
```

A name has letters, digits, `-` and `_`. The site swaps the marker for the component it registers under that name. Each site keeps its own list of names, so agree on a new name with the site before you release a page that uses it.

## Code

Fenced code blocks are highlighted at build time. Name the language on the fence (` ```tsx `). Which languages are loaded is the site's choice, not yours: the site declares its list, and adds any language a docs package needs. A fence with a language that is not on the site's list fails the site's build, so tell the site before you release a page with a new one.

## What fails the build

The build stops and names the file and line of each problem, with the fix:

- a page with no `title` or no `description`;
- no `nav.json`, or a `nav.json` that is not a list of groups, each with a `label` and `pages`;
- a page that `nav.json` does not list, a page it lists twice, or an entry with no page;
- two files with one route, such as `guides.md` and `guides/index.md`;
- a link to a page that does not exist, or a relative link to a file that is not a `.md` page;
- a link whose path is written with backslash escapes or character references, which the build cannot rewrite;
- an image that is not a file under `assets/`;
- a demo marker that is not on a line of its own, or a demo name the site does not register;
- a code fence whose language the site does not load (Pagedeck's check, which names the file but not the line).

## Known limits

These are limits of the site's loader, not rules for the docs package:

- A site shows one docs package. It holds every page in one collection, named `docs`, in one locale, `en`.
- The docs use the site's one `build.passthrough.contentRoot`, which publishes the images the pages show. The site can't use it for anything else.
- `pagedeck sync` stages the images. A `pagedeck build` from a content snapshot that was pulled without a sync has no images to publish.
